# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Tool (Python + Tkinter)

A simple desktop app built with **Python and Tkinter** that demonstrates **Caesar encryption and decryption**. You can enter a message and a key, and it will encrypt or decrypt using the Caesar cipher method.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** The UI is very rough — this was a quick-and-dirty educational project. The output box is editable (yes, that’s not ideal), there’s no input validation, and styling is non-existent. But it works!

## 🧪 Features

- Basic Caesar cipher logic (shift letters by a user-defined key)  
- Encrypt and decrypt buttons  
- Text boxes for input, key, and output  
- GUI built with Tkinter (no polish)
